# legal-word2vec


## Introduction
The legal Word2Vec model is trained with a corpus of UK Parliament hansard debates (available [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xsvp45cbt4/2mark)). The corpus consists of 1251 motion speeches taken from 129 separate debates in the UK House of Commons from 1997-2017. 

## Visualisation
The trained legal word embeddings in the dense space can be visualised with a 2-dimensional PCA model:

A Gaussian KDE overlay is superimposed on the scatterplot to enhance visualisation of density distributions.
